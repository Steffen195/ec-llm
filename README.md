# Materials Science Database x Large Language Model

This repository contains a small weekend-hack project on combining ontologies and LLMs using Retrieval Augmented Generation. Implemented with streamlit and Olamma models. 

The project was done for a presentation in the course Datamanagement in Theory and Practice for Chemistry by Prof. Helge Stein.
